Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars , and they say that it 's cheaper and better for the environment . About me , I think that cars are an easier and affordable way to travel between places , because cars are here any time and so near to your home instead of public transportation , which means you should take a walk to reach it in most countries , and also cars are available all the time . You can go at 4 am and no one says anything , because it 's yours , but most public transportation is available only for the day hours and a few hours at night . In emergency situations , for example , what you will do , if you do not have your own car , your kid is sick , or your wife or your old parents , and the government is able to help the homeless people in general .
For example , maybe you have a personal situation that is very important to you , but you do not want your family to know about it , so you decide to tell your best friend , because you know she wo n't tell anybody .
I think that public transport has a future . Indeed , travelling in a car is much more comfortable , because you do n't have to walk to take a bus or the underground .
For instance , when you read , you have to associate characters and places , and memorize details .

Almost everyone hates other people gossiping about their private lives .
