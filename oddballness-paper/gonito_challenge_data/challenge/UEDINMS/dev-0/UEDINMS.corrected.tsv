Dear Mr Jones
These days , the computer is part of your own life . You use it all the time . Some time you are a person or another is just the thing you need to do , like go to the bank , use the transport , go shopping etc . It is a machine that makes life easy and ibendow you can carry it everywhere , which is amazing the way , as the way the computer changes the programme , it is more quick and useful and practical .

By car , we can just stay with ourselves , which can be good , because we can listen to the music that we like and we do need to be around people that are unknown , but if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both modes of transport are good and cars do n't necessarily need to end up with public transport .

Dear Manager of the Summer Camp USA
To conclude , I think that technology has improved many aspects of our daily life .

While the hyper - sexualisation of our society may be a reality that many parents would want to protect their children from , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready for the society in which they live and , for many parents , sending their children to a mixed - sex school is just a natural environment much more similar to the outside world in which they will grow to adulthood .

I am writing to you to give you some advice about the International Arts Festival .
Subjects like passport travel documents , third country citizens ' inhumane treatment or punishment will be the main criteria of the exam .

Who cares about us ?

I think I have sufficient background and my GPA is good enough .
However , since I was a child I have noticed that , except for the medical facilities and achievements , it has brought me more disadvantages than advantages . I still remember the day the television came to my house . I was only seven and everybody was excited about the new toy .

We suppose that in our free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping .
We could begin the afternoon with sport , showing the different places with their surroundings near the wild . It would give a good impression .
But let 's talk about work there .
Old computers were used to occupy one entire room ; now they only have the size of a box , even the size of a book .

Talking about places to eat or dance near the Grand Station , you can find the Num Pang a good place to eat sandwiches .
