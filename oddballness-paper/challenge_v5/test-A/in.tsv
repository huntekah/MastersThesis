I used to write letters but it takes time to arrive there or sometimes disappear so E - mail is brilliant for my life .
It was Paul , my teacher , who came to see what I was doing there .
In the camp I can practise them alot .
Firstly , create your timetable .

Dear manager ,

Very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament store and buy things which they do not need .
I think we can make a conclusion : during the centuries man 's clothes have been becoming less heavy and luxurious and more common .
But , in life , you ca n't hold onto the past . You have to keep moving forward .
As I see your programme the shopping is at the same time of the London Fashion so I 'll make you a suggestion : we 'll start in the morning with the Science Museum and immediately after we 'll go to Central Exhibition Hall without doing shopping .
On the other hand though , people can become anti social , just because of the lack of real face to face meetings .

If you come , I promise you 'll never forget it !
And , unless you suffer from your heart , you should climb the 350 steps which carry you to the top .
